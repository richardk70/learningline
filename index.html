                    Our dyslexic students are smart, creative kids who have a hard time proving their 
                    intelligence in the classroom. They have been let down by their previous school, which has 
                    often misdiagnosed or ignored dyslexia symptoms. Doing the wrong things over and 
                    over again won’t help them. Our dyslexia learning program meets each student where 
                    they are by utilizing small learning groups and diagnostic teaching with targeted, 
                    specialized dyslexia tutoring. The result is real progress that allows them to 
                    transition back to a more typical school setting.

                    primary concerns, previous therapy, assessments, and present diagnoses. 
                    Consultations serve as a chance to meet the client, family, and/or related

                    communication needs and goals. 

                    When a child underachieves in school, it is crucial to identify the underlying 
                    cause as soon as possible. As a rule, the older a child is, the harder it is to 
                    address a learning difference. We offer consultations to evaluate your child’s 
                    screening and assessment needs.

                    This initial consultation can provide:
                <ul>
                    <li>Preliminary evaluation regarding likelihood of presence of dyslexia or phonemic awareness deficit.</li>
                    <li>Recommendations regarding further assessments, and if required, referrals to trusted professionals.</li>
                    <li>Information about appropriate schooling and tutoring options in the Los Angeles area.</li>
                    <li>How Learning Line can or cannot meet your student’s needs.</li>
                    <li>Correct steps to take to get your child on a successful learning path.</li>

                <div class='header'>Tutoring</div>
                We offer after school tutoring. These sessions are appropriate for 
                students having either a deficit in Phonemic Awareness and/or Dyslexia. 
                These learning differences commonly occur together. All can be corrected with 
                regular tutoring using research-based, simultaneous, multi-sensory methods. 
                We feature the Milan Method and the Barton Reading and Spelling System.

                <div class='bold'>I’ve Tried Tutoring, But It Didn’t Work</div>
                These learning differences require specialized, highly-targeted techniques. 
                Most tutoring centers do not have the trained staff to successfully remediate these learning 
                differences and, in fact, can often do more harm than good as a result.</p>
                
                <p>
                <div class='bold'>How Do I Know If My Child Has These Learning Differences?</div>
                Dyslexia and a lack of phonemic awareness can be accurately identified as early as 
                kindergarten. Before a student is accepted into the tutoring program, they must have 
                specific academic testing by a trained professional.
