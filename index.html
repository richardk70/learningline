                    <div class='cell'>What is Dyslexia?</div>
                    <div class='cell reg'>Dyslexia is a learning difference characterized by difficulty learning to read and spell. 
                        It is not indicative of intellectual deficits.</div>
                    <div>&nbsp;</div>
                    <div class='cell'>What is Phonemic Awareness?</div>
                    <div class='cell reg'>Phonemic Awareness is the ability to hear, identify, and manipulate individual sounds in 
                    spoken words. Dyslexic students who lack phonemic awareness cannot learn how to read and spell.</div>

                <div class='header'>Consultations</div>
                <div class='body'>Consultations gather general information about a client, including 
                    primary concerns, previous therapy, assessments, and present diagnoses. 
                    Consultations serve as a chance to meet the client, family, and/or related 
                    professionals to discuss the best approaches towards meeting the client's 
                    communication needs and goals. 

                    When a child underachieves in school, it is crucial to identify the underlying 
                    cause as soon as possible. As a rule, the older a child is, the harder it is to 
                    address a learning difference. We offer consultations to evaluate your child’s 
                    screening and assessment needs.

                    This initial consultation can provide:
           
                    <ul>
                        <li>Preliminary evaluation regarding likelihood of presence of dyslexia or phonemic awareness deficit.</li>
                        <li>Recommendations regarding further assessments, and if required, referrals to trusted professionals.</li>
                        <li>Information about appropriate schooling and tutoring options in the Los Angeles area.</li>
                        <li>How Learning Line can or cannot meet your student’s needs.</li>

                        <li>General information about Dyslexia.</li>

                        and fluency, and social pragmatic skills. The evaluation includes formal 
                        standardized testing, informal observation, and parent and/or client interview. 
                        Treatment plan and recommendations are provided based on outcome. </div>

                            We offer after school tutoring. These sessions are appropriate for 
                            students having either a deficit in Phonemic Awareness and/or Dyslexia. 
                            These learning differences commonly occur together. All can be corrected with 
                            regular tutoring using research-based, simultaneous, multi-sensory methods.

                        These learning differences require specialized, highly-targeted techniques. 
                        Most tutoring centers do not have the trained staff to successfully remediate these learning 
                        differences and, in fact, can often do more harm than good as a result.</p>

                    <div class='body'>
                    Dyslexia and a lack of phonemic awareness can be accurately identified as early as 
                    kindergarten. Before a student is accepted into the tutoring program, they must have 
                    specific academic testing by a trained professional.

                Our dyslexic students are smart, creative kids who have a hard time proving their 
                intelligence in the classroom. They have been let down by their previous school, which has 
                often misdiagnosed or ignored dyslexia symptoms. Doing the wrong things over and 
                over again won’t help them. Our dyslexia learning program meets each student where 
                they are by utilizing small learning groups and diagnostic teaching with targeted, 
                specialized dyslexia tutoring. The result is real progress that allows them to 
                transition back to a more typical school setting.

        <div class='body'>Learning Line.org is considered an out-of-network provider. All services are 
            self-pay. We do not file with any insurance companies. However, we will gladly provide a 
            monthly invoice that can be submitted to your insurance company for an out-of-network 
            reimbursement if applicable. Appropriate CPT procedure and diagnostic codes will clearly be 
            indicated on the invoice.  
        <p>While a doctor's referral is often necessary for getting authorization and coverage from 
            your insurance company, your child can be seen without a referral. Please check with your 
            insurance company for more information regarding reimbursement and whether pre-authorization 
            is necessary.</p>

        <p class='body'>Please contact our office directly for more information regarding individual 
            fees. The fee for therapy is based on an hourly rate and includes time spent in direct 
            therapy with the child and consultation with the family. An individual therapy session 
            begins at $90 for a 60-minute session. Shorter sessions may be discussed, particularly for 
            children under the age of 3.

        <div class='header'>Cancellations</div>
        <div class='body'>A 24-hour notice is required in the event of a cancellation. Missed 
            appointments without a 24-hour notice are subject to a cancellation fee. We understand 
            that unforeseen circumstances and sicknesses do happen. In the event of a sickness, 
            please call to give notice of your cancellation as soon as possible.
            <p>The success of your therapy sessions depends on consistency. The child's plan and goals 
                are based on having a consistent treatment schedule. In the event of a cancellation, 
                a re-scheduled appointment is strongly encouraged to maintain progress.</p>
